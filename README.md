# Customer-Segmentation
This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic features. The goal is to help businesses understand customer patterns and improve marketing strategies.

## Dataset

* **Type:** Customer data
* **Format:** CSV
* **Typical Features:**

  * `CustomerID`
  * `Age`
  * `Annual Income`
  * `Spending Score`
  * Other behavioral or demographic attributes

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

---

## Machine Learning Techniques

* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* Feature Scaling
* **K-Means Clustering**
* Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection
* Cluster visualization and interpretation

---

## Key Analysis Performed

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Identification of customer segments
* Visualization of customer clusters
* Behavioral analysis of each segment

---

## Insights

* Customers can be grouped into distinct segments based on spending behavior
* High-income, high-spending customers form a premium segment
* Low-spending customers may require targeted promotions
* Segmentation helps in personalized marketing and business decision-making
